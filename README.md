BBDC is a web application that introduced a new processing model for big data inspired by the MapReduce framework.
The idea behind this project was to address the shortage of computing resources for researchers working on computation-intensive programs. While cloud computing was a potential solution, it had challenges such as high-cost services, communication problems, and unavailability. To overcome these challenges crowd computing has been proposed as an alternative solution. Crowd computing is a distributed computing system where multiple mobile and non-mobile devices contribute their free computing resources to process workloads. I aimed to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly programming model for developing computation-intensive programs in a distributed manner within the crowd computing environment, inspired by the MapReduce programming model.
BBDC divides jobs into tasks, distributes them to volunteers, and collects the results. Additionally, I developed a scheduling algorithm that outperformed the FIFO algorithm, reducing program execution time. The project used node.js and PHP for the server-side, JavaScript for the client-side, and Redis and Kafka for caching and storage purposes, respectively.
